### Continued development

In the future I intend to implement more things in this project with javascript, such as dark and light mode, user interaction with the page, among others. 

### Useful resources

- Making this screen helped me to put into practice my knowledge about css, flexbox, html and other things... thus making me use this knowledge to make this design.
